# Letter Speaker

This site is built to allow a user to see and hear the letters they are pressing. 

I created it because I wasn't able to find a similar solution after some searching.

Feel free to customize if you'd like!

## Audio Files

The files in /audio are clearly named. If you'd like a different voice on them, replace them. 

I found the quickest way to do this was to record, with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org), the speaker clearly saying them. Then select each letter waveform, and "Export Selection" as an MP3 to the /audio folder.

## Used Tools

I used the sounds.js file from [https://flukeout.github.io/simple-sounds/](https://flukeout.github.io/simple-sounds/) to make playing the sounds easier.

The page template and base CSS is from [https://html5boilerplate.com/](https://html5boilerplate.com/).
